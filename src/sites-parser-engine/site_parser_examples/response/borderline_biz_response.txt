Its a collection of audio interviews ever given by a person. I created this to scratch my own itch. I listen to a lot of podcast and most of the interviews of Elon Musk were on youtube. Also I wasnt interested in the 10-15 min media interviews, I wanted to learn about the philosophy of the the interviewee. Plus some podcasts are not available on itunes, some are outdated and there are no xml scripts. The goal was to have a local collection of audio files, if they are not available anywhere and make a podcast app, where the major theme is the person being interviewed not the podcast show that he/she appeared on. So imagine a central location of all the audio interviews ever given by a person. A youtube for audio interviews. WHY AM I SELLING I have recently been admitted to a graduate school, and would have no time to manage this.

            "description": " Ionic Video Chat Email OwnerFully functional real time Video and Group Text chat app similar to Viber or WhatsApp. It has full multi-platform support for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux built using Ionic 2. There are two separate versions, for Ionic 1 and 2, both of which generate income on the marketplace, and include a Node backend. I am running out of time to maintaining them, as I am spending time on Unity rather than Ionic lately.
